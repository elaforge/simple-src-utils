  * options with --
  * --wrapped adds leading space
  * ensure single line works
  * real tests, empty line handling and round trip
  - documentation
  * ignore but retain trailing or leading blank lines
  - I might want to be able to ignore but preserve leading gunk on the first
    line, e.g. for
    ( "blah\
      \ blah"
    , ...
    )
  - configurable indentation
  vim:
    - vim config uses variable for --wrapped
    - What about variable indentation?
      . I can infer it easily enough when stripping, but I have to store what it
        was to go back.
      . Same problem as inferring the style.
    - I can infer the style when going to raw, but then how to go back?
      . I could set a vim variable.
  lines:
    * doesn't dedent properly
    - support --wrapped
