fmt-signature
  . Bind to equalprg.
  . Wrap before -> or =>
  . Treat ()s as one word.
  * basic implementation
  * test
  - ignore lines with comments
    . Any line with a comment goes through unchanged.
    . Break input into lines without comments and wrap each section
      separately.  The only wrinkle is that only the first line of the first
      section isn't indented.
  - configure indentation
  - can I get vim to expand the selection to the whole signature?


string-literal
  * options with --
  * --wrapped adds leading space
  * ensure single line works
  * real tests, empty line handling and round trip
  * documentation
  * ignore but retain trailing or leading blank lines
  - backslash adds 1+3 characters, which means I have to set tw=76, which is
    pretty annoying.
    . lines also adds 3+1, backslash wrapped adds 2 usually.
    . I could dedent by the added characters, but then I wind up with
      irregular indents.  Some people might not mind that, but I do.
    . I can set vim tw-=4, but then I have to set it back when toggling back,
      and vim doesn't know which direction I just went.
  - I might want to be able to ignore but preserve leading gunk on the first
    line, e.g:
      ( "blah\
        \ blah"
      , ...
      )
  - Also I could ignore non-indented leading lines, e.g.
      variable =
        "blah blah"
  * configurable indentation
    . I retain existing indentation.
  vim:
    - vim config uses variable for --wrapped
    - What about variable indentation?
      . I can infer it easily enough when stripping, but I have to store what it
        was to go back.
      . Same problem as inferring the style.
    / I can infer the style when going to raw, but then how to go back?
      . I could set a vim variable.
      . Actually I don't need this, since I keep the indent.
    - vip works for a single paragraph, but not if there are spaces inside,
      and not if there's a dedented 'variable = ...' header.  Is there some
      text object that selects everything at and below this indent level, and
      is not fooled by blank lines?
  lines:
    * doesn't dedent properly
    - support --wrapped
