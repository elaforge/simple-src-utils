Some small source code manipulation tools I use with vim.  They're external
filters, though, so if you use acme instead of vim, they should work fine there
too.  See included `vimrc` for examples.

- cmt - Comment and uncomment code.

- string-literal - Toggle between raw text and list of lines or Haskell
backslash string gap style.
